//Question 40
console.log(`Q40: Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album. The function
                  should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a Object containing these two pieces 
                  of information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. Print each return 
                  value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly. Add an optional parameter to 
                  make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a value 
                  for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. Make at least one new function call that 
                  includes the number of tracks on an album.
